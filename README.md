A leaflet map with where you can hear the names of Icelandic volcanoes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This map uses the html audio tag to create a sound player within each popup where the user can hear names of Icelandic Volcanoes
pronounced. The map utilizes the [Leaflet-providers extension]( https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers),
[Font Awesome Icons]( http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). This map was created as a final project for
a geovisualization class at [Lehman College](http://www.lehman.edu/academics/eggs/MS_GISc.php)/City University of New York 
instructed by [Gretchen Culp](http://bl.ocks.org/gmculp). The volcanoes featured on the map are the same volcanoes monitored
by [The Icelandic Meteorological Office]( http://en.vedur.is/earthquakes-and-volcanism/volcanic-eruptions/) for aviation safety.
